These are production Jamf Pro shell scripts I've written for my work Jamf Cloud instance (with a few changes) or occasionally to help out others on those days I'm feeling generous. 

Please note:
* For the love of all that is bright and beautiful, TEST BEFORE USING. Don't trust that what works properly on my Jamf Pro will work the same on yours.
* Better yet, UNDERSTAND BEFORE USING. I comment a fair amount in these scripts, and I also tend to write out certain commands that others shorten (see my cURLs). Hopefully you find that helpful to understand what's happening in the script or if you adapt a script for your particular purposes or instance.
* Please use API credentials that have the least permissions necessary for the job. 
* Similarly, consider using [this](https://github.com/macnotes/jamfscripts/tree/main/jamfpro/getJamfApiCredentials) or another method to mask your API credentials.
* Licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/MatthewPrins/Jamf/blob/main/LICENSE) â€” read it, it's only 21 lines long.
